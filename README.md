# ASSEMBLY_Simple_Function

Second project in assembly code. This code is a simple function that multiply at the power 3 the number 5.  
The value ( 5 ** 3 ) is hardcoded : transforming data from an int, to a string and the reverse isn't the purpose of this project.

The goal of this project is to understand the basics of the stack and convention for declaring a function.
